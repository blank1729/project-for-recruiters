# project-for-recruiters

This project is for all those recruiters who are bugging me for a project to show my skills. I am a begginer, self-thaught and I have no "REAL" Projects I have worked on. I do not want to create any ox shit projects and say that they are my life work and crap. But since you really want me to show something on my resume, **This Project is decicated to everyone of you**

P.S _I do not mean to offend anyone with this and I am not a nerd to show some extradonary skills here. I am just annoyed by people asking me this question again and again_
